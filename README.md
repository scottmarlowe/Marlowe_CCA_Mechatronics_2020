WEEK 2

Single crank driving three pulleys with levers and cams. Belts tend to slip and pulleys are being pulled off axis.

WEEK 3

Motor cannot drive the device due to poor mechanical construction causing wobble and friction.

Failure attempting to drive the belt with separate motor-driven pulley.
